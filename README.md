# Random-Forest-Regression

# Introduction to Random Forest Regression:
  In regression task we can use Random Forest Regression technique for predicting numerical values. It predicts continuous values by averaging the results of multiple decision trees.

# Overview:
  This project demonstrates the implementation of Random Forest Regression using Python. The model is trained to predict outcomes based on a given dataset.

# Dataset
  1. The dataset used is in CSV format.
  2. It contains multiple independent variables (features) and one dependent variable (target).

# Dependencies
  Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the notebook:
  @pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

# Steps Covered in the Notebook
  1. Importing Libraries – Loading essential libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn.
  2. Loading Dataset – Reading data from a CSV file.
  3. Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling if required.
  4. Model Training – Implementing the Random Forest Regression model using sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.
  5. Predictions & Evaluation – Making predictions and evaluating performance using metrics like RMSE, R²-score, and visualizations.

# Usage
  To run the notebook:
    1. Open Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
    2. Upload the dataset if required.
    3. Execute the cells step by step.

# Results
  The model provides predictions based on the trained data.
  Performance is evaluated through visualization and statistical measures.
